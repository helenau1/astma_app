##### AsthmaApp

AsthmaApp is a sports diary specially designed for asthmatics, so they can monitor their medicine use related to sports activities. 
AsthmaApp requires user registration. Once registered the user can submit data of the sport activities and medicine use, 
get statistics of the submitted data, update their password or delete all the data they have submitted to the sports diary. 
Pictures of the GUI can be found from the GUI_images file.

The project was part of a PHP/SQL course offered by the Laurea University of Applied Sciences.
