AsthmaApp

AsthmaApp is a sports diary specially designed for asthmatics, so they can monitor their medicine use related to sports activities. 
AsthmaApp requires user registration. Once registered the user can submit data of the sport activities and medicine use, 
get statistics of the submitted data, update their password or delete all the data they have submitted to the sports diary. 
Pictures of the GUI can be found from the GUI_images file.

The project was part of a PHP/SQL course offered by the Laurea University of Applied Sciences.

How to Setup:

Download the .zip from this GitHub repository and save the folder under "C:\xampp\htdocs" directory. Name it "asthma_app".
Launch Apache and MySQL (for example with XAMPP).
Go to phpMyAdmin and import the "asthma_app_database.sql" script from SQL folder. It creates the database, the tables and inserts some test data.

Open "http://localhost/asthma_app/index.php" in your web browser. 
Create your own account on the "Sign up" page to test the app, or sign in with the test account 
using email "tester@tester.com" and "password" as a password to check out the test data.
